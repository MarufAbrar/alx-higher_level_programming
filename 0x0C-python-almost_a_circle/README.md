# Python almost a circle

## Python Unit Tests
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start with test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: 
    python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: 
    python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case
